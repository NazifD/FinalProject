# FinalProject

What is it?

  This project takes all of the statistics from players in the NBA 2023-24 postseason (playoff stats), and focuses specifically on finding the best defensive player regarding centers, and the best offensive players regarding forwards, to assist in making the best possible   fantasy NBA team. The current exaxmple helps fantasy players get at least 2 slots for both sides of the game (offensive and defense), but really all the inputs can be changed to choose any type of player. 

How does it work?

  It filters through the NBA postseason stats, looking at players classified as "C" for center and "F" for forward and averages the top 3 most important stats relative to the position and gives the output on a bar graph, aswell as outputing the top 3 highest results into   the console. To operate you can just hit run, if you want change and see other types of players stats you can manually change the code which is instructed in the comments. 

Why should people care?

  This code can be extremely helpful for classmates into sports betting since most mainstream betting apps have individual bets for player stats making the interpretation of the bets easier. The code also gives a great perspective for picks during an nba fantasy league. If our classmates were in a fantasy basketball   league they can use this code to identify what the positives and negatives of their teams are and improve their team. 

What did I learn?

  I learned much more about which players are better under pressure since it is playoff stats. I also increased my overall knowledge in knowing players strenghts and weaknesses. 

Future Improvements

  I would like to have a code where the user types in a name and the console automatically outputs their averages instead of potentially not catering to everyone and making classmates manually change the code even though its minor changes.
